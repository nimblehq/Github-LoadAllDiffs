# Github LoadAllDiffs

A chrome extension to add `Load All Diffs` button for Github pull requests

![2019_06_26_18_38_54](/.github/load-all-diffs.gif)

Inspired by [github_load_all_diffs.js](https://gist.github.com/juanca/5fd799c5b094e3e4f8b709cd101d7403#file-github_load_all_diffs-js), due to Github limition for [viewing content and diffs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/limits-for-viewing-content-and-diffs-in-a-repository), we have to load diffs manually in PR one by one (a little bit lazy and easy to ignore code changes when reviewing :sweat_smile:)
